pinentry-emojiprompt \- Emoji-based pinentry implementation for GnuPG
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY pinentry\-emojiprompt
.YS
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The pinentry-emojiprompt executable described in this manual page represents the
pinentry implementation based on emojiprompt, providing emoji-based password
feedback for GnuPG operations.
.
.P
When entering passwords or passphrases for GPG operations, pinentry-emojiprompt
displays emojis or emoticons instead of asterisks, helping users verify they've
typed their password correctly before submission.
.
.P
For general information on emojiprompt, read
.BR emojiprompt (1).
.
.
.SH USE WITH GPG
.P
To use pinentry-emojiprompt as the password prompt for
.BR gpg (1)
you need to configure
.BR gpg-agent (1).
For example by creating the file \fB~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf\fR and writing into
it the following line:
.
.P
.B pinentry-program /path/to/pinentry-emojiprompt
.
.P
Note that the path to the pinentry-emojiprompt executable depends on how you
installed it and/or how it was packaged.
.
.P
After updating the configuration, restart the gpg-agent:
.RS
.B gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
